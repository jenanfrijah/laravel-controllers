###PART 7####

Normal Controller routes :- you create each route manually for every method.
Resource Controller routes :– Laravel creates 7 routes automatically for all CRUD actions.

#How many routes were created automatically? 7
#When should we use a resource controller? when we need full CRUD operations.
# the difference :  normal routes are manual, resource routes are automatic and organized for CRUD.


#When should I use a **normal controller**?
Use a normal controller for simple or custom actions that don’t need full CRUD.

#When should I use a **resource controller**?
Use a resource controller when you need all CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

#What is the full request flow?
Full request flow: User => Route => Controller => Model (optional) => View => User.
